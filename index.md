I have not yet found my personal identity as a programmer, as I have not explored much beyond the content of the UCSD courses, but I do not feel rushed to learn faster or a victim of the impostor syndrome, as I admire the following words from Itachi Uchiha:
> Knowledge and awareness are vague, and perhaps better called illusions.

A petty reason why I dislike Java is having to type `System.out.println()` while C++ is as simple as `cout << ___`
